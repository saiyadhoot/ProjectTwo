"This Is Our Dream"

# project overview
This project is a visual translation of the poem "This is Our Dream", with various animations and transitions that would create more optical symbolisms for a better understanding. As a crowdsourced poem created by NPR, it combines the voices of various people around the country. It mirrors the ideas of how hopes and dreams are universal, connecting people across various backgrounds. It serves as a reminder that dreams, when shared, can inspire action and change.

# technical overview
The animations match with the literal representation of the words. Examples include "up" and "down", and having them go in their respective direction. Colors are also a vivid example that can give more interaction with the poem. Examples include "blue ocean" and "scales weigh".
